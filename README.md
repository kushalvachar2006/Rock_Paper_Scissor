# Rock_Paper_Scissor
A PYTHON PROGRAM
# Description
In this program the user has to give the number of matches he/she wishes to play as input.
Nxt there will be three options,
1. Rock
2. Paper
3. Scissor
   
Since we are playing with computer you need to import random module by and set the range for 1 2 3 only
We should type all this code under a for loop until the range of the number of matches given by the user
This is all about the program.
So please do follow me for more coding examples
